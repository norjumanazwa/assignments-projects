💉 Seeing Science in Action: Our Visit to Biocon 

Date : 23 Dec 2025

A few days before Christmas, I had the incredible chance to visit Biocon Sdn. Bhd. with Assoc. Prof. Dr. Azurah binti Abu Samah. Walking into the Drug Product department where they produce insulin was a real "wow" moment. Our instructor, Mr. Jaya, walked us through the entire journey—from the initial yeast fermentation all the way to the final packaging.

It was fascinating to see how a perfectly synchronized dance of machines and automated systems works together to create life-saving medicine. Seeing these theories come to life in such a controlled, high-stakes environment made everything I’ve studied in class finally click. I’m so grateful to the Biocon team for being such welcoming hosts and giving us a peek into the future of pharmaceutical tech!
