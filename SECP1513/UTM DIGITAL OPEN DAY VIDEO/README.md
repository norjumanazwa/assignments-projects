📌 Recapping UTMDigital Open Day 2025

I spent my day at the UTMDigital Open Day on October 28th, and it was a great deep dive into the industry. I got to see firsthand how networking and IT security work in a real organizational setting, which made everything I've been learning in class feel much more "real."

Hearing directly from practitioners at the tech booths was incredibly motivating. It was a solid reminder of how much I enjoy computer science and how much more there is to learn. I'm leaving the event feeling inspired and ready to keep leveling up my skills!
