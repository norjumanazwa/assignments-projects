🔊 Learning the Ropes with Serunai Commerce 

Date : 18 Dec 2025

On December 18th, I attended a really insightful talk by Ts. Abdul Alim Abdul Muttalib from Serunai Commerce. He’s the Head of Tech and Innovation there, and he spent the session breaking down how they actually build and manage systems in the real world.

We took a deep dive into the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)—specifically the tug-of-war between the traditional Waterfall method and the fast-paced Agile approach. What really stuck with me, though, was his take on "agentic coding." He pointed out that in today’s world, using AI isn't just an "extra" skill; it’s becoming a requirement to keep up with the industry. Honestly, the session was a huge confidence booster. It reminded me why I love computer science and pushed me to keep learning as much as I can. To wrap it all up, I worked on an academic report to document everything we covered.
