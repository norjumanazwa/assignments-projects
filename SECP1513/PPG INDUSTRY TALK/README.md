🎨 Insights from the PPG Industry Talk 

Date : 20 November 2025

On November 20th, I had the opportunity to attend an industry talk by PPG, a global leader in paints and coatings. While they are known for their innovative architectural and industrial finishes, the session focused on a side of the business we don't always see: the IT department.

It was fascinating to learn how PPG uses data analytics, global infrastructure, and SAP to keep their international operations running smoothly. The talk gave me a front-row seat to how a global company manages massive amounts of data and handles complex communication across borders. To wrap things up, my team and I designed a poster to summarize everything we learned about how high-level tech keeps a global giant moving.
